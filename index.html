		<h2 id="preHardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2>
			<h3 id="IntroPreHardmode">Introduction</h3>
				<p>Pre-Hardmode is the stage your world is in before fighting the Wall of Flesh. In this stage of the game, you are expected to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>build a village</li>
					<li>mine pre-hardmode ores</li>
					<li>upgrade tools and armor</li>
					<li>fight bosses</li>
					<li>dig to hell</li>
				</ul>
			<h3 id="villageBuilding">Building a Village</h3>
				<p>Building a village is quite easy. All you have to do is build houses. You can build a house out of anything, from dirt to solid gold. They just follow a couple requirements:</p>
				<ul id="houseRequirments">
					<li>an entrance/exit</li>
					<li>a light source</li>
					<li>walls</li>
					<li>basic furnature:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>a chair</li>
						<li>a table</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<h3 id="miningPre">Pre-Hardmode Mining</h3>
				<p>Mining Pre-Hardmode ores is simple. You just dig down and mine shiny rocks. The rocks that are shiny are ores, which can be melted into ingots and crafted into tools and armor. The most useful ore is iron, which is the only one that is used throughout the game. Make sure to mine lots of it!</p>
			<h3 id="upgradePre">Upgrading Tools and Armor</h3>
				<p>Upgrading your gear is easy! The ingots can be crafted into better tools and armor. Just make sure to check the strength of it, just to be sure that it is an upgrade. In order to craft these new items, you need an anvil, which is typically made from iron(told you it was useful!)</p>
			<h3 id="bossesPreHardmode">Pre-Hardmode Bosses</h3>
				<p>Fighting Pre-Hardmode bosses is probably the most challenging thing you'll have to do before Hardmode. You need sufficient skill, gear, and an arena. Each boss has different health, defense, attack strength, attacks, and weakpoints. However, most of the Pre-Hardmode bosses don't have a specific weakpoint. An attack on any point of it's body will damage it. The bosses you will fight are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>King Slime</li>
					<li>Eye of Cthulhu</li>
					<li>Evil Boss</li>
					<li>Skeletron</li>
					<li>Wall of Flesh</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Looking at the list, one boss stands out: Evil Boss. This is because it isn't one boss. Depending on which evil your world gets, either Corruption or Crimson, you will get one of two bosses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Eater of Worlds for the Corruption</li>
					<li>Brain of Cthulhu for the Crimson</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Each boss is summoned a different way, which is discovered while you play the game.</p>
			<h3 id="hellDigging">Digging to Hell</h3>
				<p>Digging to Hell is a pretty straightforward task: dig down until you see lava oceans and demons. Hell is a pretty dangerous place, and everything there is stronger than your typicall monsters. When me and my friends were playing, we thought that we were prepared, but we still died a lot.</p>
		<h2 id="hardmode">Hardmode</h2>
				<h3 id="ActivateHardmode">Activating Hardmode</h3>
					<p>Activating Hardmode is no easy task. You have to defeat the Wall of Flesh, the most difficult Pre-Hardmode boss. It is the only Pre-Hardmode boss with specific weakpoints. You fight it in Hell by throwing a Guide VooDoo Doll into lava. Upon defeating it, Hardmode will be activated, and you can't go back.</p>
				<h3 id="IntroHardmode">Introduction to Hardmode</h3>
					<p>Congrats! You defeated the Wall of Flesh and gave yourself even more monsters to deal with! In Hardmode, you are expected to do a lot, including beating the game. I will be breaking Hardmode down into multiple sections:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pre-Mech Bosses</li>
						<li>Pre-Plantera</li>
						<li>Pre-Golem</li>
						<li>Pre-Lunatic Cultist</li>
						<li>Pre-Moon Lord</li>
						<li>Post-Moon Lord</li>
					</ul>
					<p>One thing you may have noticed is that these sections are split up by what boss you've defeated. That is how you move forward in Hardmode. The final boss is the Moon Lord. You can still play after defeating it, as he gives you many upgrades to your gear.</p>
